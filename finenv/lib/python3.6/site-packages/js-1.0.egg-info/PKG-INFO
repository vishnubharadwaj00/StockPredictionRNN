        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `Root directory for Fanstatic packages`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`Root directory for Fanstatic packages`: https://github.com/MiCHiLU/js
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js``) are published to some URL.
